# Accessibility in Entertainment and Beyond

The goal of this project is to create a resource for those that are underrepresented when it comes to services. The other goal is to create an extremely accessible UI that is not only accessible for anyone with a disability but for everyone. Anyone can benefit from well planned User experiences, contrasting element (especially text: color and background), and a quality experience on any device including screen readers.

## Project Proposal
### Name of Student:
Ryan Putman

### Name of Project:
Accessible Entertainment?

### Project’s Purpose or Goal:
Accessibility focused website with resources for accessible entertainment options and guidelines for developers to create accessible websites.

### List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
User can search for movie theaters that accommodate disabilities including hard of hearing and mobility issues.
Website created following best practices for making website as accessible as possible to ALL users.
React with database integration(Firebase)
Light and dark mode to give options of contrast levels easiest for user to navigate based on preference
Fandango and/or Rotten Tomatoes API for theater information.
disabledperson.com API for posting jobs that are friendly to anyone with a disability.

### If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
I would love to integrate Netflix and Hulu into the app. To be able to display information on what media has closed captioning would be amazing. Netflix is really intense about their catalog but I would like to find a workaround that doesn't cost a ton of money like third party apis I have found so far.

### What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
APIs that are free

### Is there anything else you’d like your instructor to know?
I have reached out to multiple people including my partner to be thinking about what resources they think would be valuable. I would like to reach out to Tucker Maxon Oral School to partner in some way.
